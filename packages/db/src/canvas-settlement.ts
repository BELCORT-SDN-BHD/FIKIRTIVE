/**
 * Canvas settlement — the server writes a delivered generation job's whole batch of cards.
 *
 * WHY (#601 / #599 D3): a merchant who started a batch and closed the tab used to come back to a
 * half-empty board, because the CARDS were placed by the browser that happened to be watching.
 * Placing them is now the last step of the job's completion path, so the board is complete the
 * moment the job is delivered — whether or not any browser is open.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT — read this before touching it:
 *   - It NEVER creates or enqueues a GenJob, never calls a generation provider, never touches the
 *     credit ledger, and never writes `spent` / `spentUsd` / `idempotencyKey` / the job's status.
 *     It is not a spend path. It runs strictly AFTER the job is terminal and its charge is
 *     settled, and its own failure leaves both untouched. It READS the idempotency key for one
 *     thing only — the `canvas:` prefix, which records which surface bought the job — and never
 *     derives, compares or writes a key.
 *   - It never resurrects a card the merchant deleted: tombstones are honoured by the projection,
 *     and every write happens under the same per-job advisory lock the browser-side placement
 *     takes, so the two writers converge instead of racing.
 *
 * This file is only the I/O half. WHAT should be on the board is decided by the single pure
 * projection in `@fikirtive/core` (`planCanvasSettlement`) — so a card cannot mean one thing in
 * the tab that made it and another thing after a reload.
 *
 * SCOPE (#601 T2b): the delivered (DONE) path only. Projecting failed / cancelled / timed-out
 * terminals onto a card is T2c and lands with the code that writes them.
